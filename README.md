Here's a basic API endpoint for a simple notes app, using FastAPI + sqlalchemy as an ORM. 


Installation and Running
Included a Dockerfile to handle dependencies and containerisation. When running, add the -p flag to your docker command to choose which port the app hosts on.
I've chosen PostgreSQL to hold my data, but this can be changed to suit preferences in db.py
